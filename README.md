# 🧬 Computational Analysis of piRNA for Detection of COVID-19 Samples Using Galaxy Software

This repository contains the **project report** and **presentation** for our B.Tech (Honours in Bioinformatics) project conducted under **Dr. Arpita Parakh** at **Shri Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management, Nagpur** (Session 2024–25).

## 📘 Project Overview
The study focuses on computational profiling of **PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)** in COVID-19 patient samples using the **Galaxy platform**.  
We analyzed small RNA-seq datasets from healthy, ICU, and non-ICU COVID-19 samples to identify differentially expressed piRNAs as potential biomarkers.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Galaxy Software** (for workflow-based analysis)
- **NCBI Data Repository**
- **Trimmomatic**, **FastQC**, **Bowtie2**, **BLAST**
- **piRNA Databases:** piRBase, piRNAclusterDB
